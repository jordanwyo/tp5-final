            <h3>OMORI Fan Policy || December 30, 2020</h3>
            <p>
                Hi, everyone!
                <br><br>
                First off, we would like to say: thank you for all the positive reception for OMORI! Now that we’ve gotten settled, we would like to answer a few questions that our fans may be having about fan works and merchandise!
                <br><br>
                In general, fan work is permitted and celebrated! However, please refrain from using official assets, official art, or the OMORI logo in fan work.
                If you are an individual and want to sell your fan works, please follow these guidelines:
                Please play the game before you sell any merchandise.
                Refrain from making items that are similar to official items offered by OMOCAT.
                Make sure that it is clear that your merchandise is unofficial.
                Only produce in a limited quantity and not according to demand. We ask that you do not mass-produce anything you plan to sell.
                Only sell directly to consumers. You may not sell your merchandise through large stores such as Amazon, Redbubble, or Society6.
                If you plan to sell through a company, we do not approve selling OMORI fan work. However, you may contact us at omocat@omocat.com and we may be able to negotiate.
                You may make or sell fan works for non-commercial reasons, like charity.
                We would love to let our fans express their passion for the game within these guidelines. Thank you!
