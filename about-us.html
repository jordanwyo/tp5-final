                <p>CLOVER & SEALIFE (Composer) is the project of Jami Lynne, a composer, vocalist, and electronic musician based in Seattle, Washington. With deep influence of and love for the sounds of vintage drum machines, shoegaze and city pop, CLOVER & SEALIFE sings a song of sentimentality and uncertain hope in the face of melancholy. She hopes her work on the OMORI soundtrack can express the feeling of finding small bits of joy in hopelessness, through the lens of early-CD-quality game music.</p>

                Hi, everyone!

                <br><br>
                In general, fan work is permitted and celebrated! However, please refrain from using official assets, official art, or the OMORI logo in fan work.
                If you are an individual and want to sell your fan works, please follow these guidelines:
